## Problem 1

\#\#\#\#Create a data frame comprised of:

1.  a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
2.  a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
3.  a character vector of length 10
4.  a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
dataframe = tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(10),
  logical_vec = random_sample > 0,
  char_vec =  c("a","b","c","d","e","f","j","h","i","j"),
  factor_vec = factor(c("high","medium","low","high","medium","low","high","medium","low","high") )
)
```

\#\#\#\#Take the mean of each variable

``` r
#use pull() to pull the variable out of the dataframe
#random sample / numbers vector
mean(pull(dataframe,random_sample))
```

    ## [1] 0.2688019

``` r
#logical vector
mean(pull(dataframe,logical_vec))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
#character vector
mean(pull(dataframe,char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(dataframe, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
#factor vector
mean(pull(dataframe,factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(dataframe, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

can take the mean of numbers and logical but not character or factor

\#\#\#\#Applies the as.numeric function to the logical, character and
factor

``` r
#logical vector
as.numeric(pull(dataframe,logical_vec))
#character vector
as.numeric(pull(dataframe,char_vec))
#factor vector
as.numeric(pull(dataframe,factor_vec))
```

Logical and factor vector can convert to numerical and take the mean,
however, character vector cannot.

The reason of these is that  
1. in logical vector, TURE can convert to 1 and FALSE can convert to 0  
2. in factor vector, there are 3 levels. When we use as.numeric(), the
default sorting of the levels of the factors is sorted in alphabetical
order. We can find that it converted “high” to 1, “low” to 2, and
“medium” to 3  
3. in character vector, it contains several strings. strings cannot
simply convert to numbers

It also explained why logical vector has a mean, but factor and
character not. In the definition, mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, …), x
can be numeric/logical vectors and date, date-time and time interval
objects.

## Problem 2

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
print(penguins)

    ## # … with 334 more rows, and 2 more variables: sex <fct>, year <int>

The penguins dataset contains penguin species (Adelie, Chinstrap,
Gentoo), islands( Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen) and bill length, bill depth,
flipper length, body mass, sex, and year.  
The dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns.  
The mean flipper length is 200.9152047 mm.

#make a scatterplot
